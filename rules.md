% Snowplow Race
% Team B11: Vivian Becker, Peter Morganelli, Norman Ramsey, Kaelen Song, Selin Tuncay

## Theme

You and your team are the crack snowplow operators of the Department of Public Works.
Working together, you can clear the roads before the start of the morning commute.

## Object of the game

Play takes place on a **map** in which each **intersection** and **dead end** is marked with a **blue circle**.
At the start of play, every **road** that connects two blue circles is covered with **snow**, represented by a small wooden disk.
Players **move** about the map, taking **turns** and picking up snow.
Each move transfers a snowplow from its **origin blue circle** to its **destination blue circle**.
Each turn takes one minute on the **game clock**.
Each turn may (or may not) **clear* a unit of snow from the map.
The object of the game is to clear _all_ the snow from the map before the game clock shows 6:00 AM.

## Setup

A *short game* uses only the _navy blue_ circles.
A *full game* uses all the blue circles.

To set up the game, 

1. Place one unit of snow on every street that directly connects two blue circles.
2. Place all the snowplows on the blue circle labeled DPW.
3. Assign one of the colored snowplow to each player.  Each player gets their own color.
3. For a short game, set the game clock to 5:00.  For a full game, set the game clock to 4:30.^[Note: times should probably depend on the number of players.  These times are a guess for a three-player game, using the map we playtested on Friday February 7.]

## Play

Players take turns.  The first turn is taken by the player who most recently shoveled snow.
Play then passes to the left.

At the start of each player's turn, every snowplow on the map is on one of the blue circles.
On your turn, you

1. Advance the game clock by one minute
1. Move your snowplow from its current ("origin") blue circle along a road to any **adjacent** blue circle: the **destination**.  (Two blue circles are adjacent if they are connected by road and no other blue circles intervene.)  This part of your turn is called a **step**.
1. Pick up ("clear") the snow, if any, on the road connecting the origin blue circle and the destination blue circle.

Once your snowplow has reached its destination blue circle, it is the next player's turn.

The game ends when there is no more snow on the map.  The players win if the game ends before the game clock reaches 6:00.

## Advanced play

Once players have mastered a map, they can add an additional rule.
On your turn you may

4. Move your snowplow up to *three* steps, *provided* that
    - All the steps take place on the same road.
    - Steps are in a straight line (no turns).
    - *None* of the steps collect any snow.
