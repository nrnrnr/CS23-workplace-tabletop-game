% Snowplow Race
% Team B11: Vivian Becker, Peter Morganelli, Norman Ramsey, Kaelen Song, Selin Tuncay

## Theme

You and your team are the crack snowplow operators of the Department of Public Works.
Working together, you can clear the roads before the start of the morning commute.

## The game board and its terminology

The game takes place on the **map** of Pleasantville:

- Each **intersection** and **dead end** is marked with a **blue circle**.
- Many blue circles are connected by **roads**; each road is rendered as a line in purple or light blue highlighter.
- At the start of play, every road is covered with **snow**, represented by a small wooden disk.
- Each player controls a model **snowplow**.
- Players **move** about the map, taking **turns** and picking up snow.
- Each move transfers a snowplow from its **origin blue circle** to its **destination blue circle**.
- Each turn takes one minute on the **game clock**.
- Each turn may (or may not) **clear** a unit of snow from the map.

## Object of the game

The object of the game is to clear _all_ the snow from the map before the game clock shows 6:00 AM.

## Setup

A *short game* uses only the _navy blue_ circles and the _purple_ roads.
A *full game* uses all the blue circles and both purple and blue roads.

To set up the game, 

1. Place one unit of snow on every read in use.
2. Place all the snowplows on the blue circle labeled DPW.
3. Assign one of the colored snowplow to each player.  Each player gets their own color.
3. For a short game, set the game clock to 5:00.  For a full game, set the game clock to 4:30.^[Note: times should probably depend on the number of players.  These times are a guess for a three-player game, using the map we playtested on Friday February 7.]
   To represent the clock, the team recommends the Hours Minutes Time Calculator app for iOS or Android.

## Play

Players take turns.  The first turn is taken by the player who most recently shoveled snow.
Play then passes to the left.

At the start of your turn, every snowplow on the map---including yours---is on one of the blue circles.  (Multiple snowplows can be on the same circle.)
On your turn, you

1. Advance the game clock by one minute.
1. Move your snowplow from its current ("origin") blue circle to any **destination** blue circle that is directly connected to the origin circle by road.  No other blue circle may intervene.  This part of your turn is called a **step**.
1. Pick up ("clear") the snow, if any, on the road connecting the origin blue circle and the destination blue circle.

Once your snowplow has reached its destination blue circle, it is the next player's turn.

The game ends when there is no more snow on the map.  The players win if the game ends before the game clock reaches 6:00.

## Advanced play

Once players have mastered a map, you can add an additional rule.
On your turn you may

4. Move your snowplow up to *three* steps, *provided* that
    - All the steps take place on the same road.
    - Steps are in a straight line (no turns).
    - *None* of the steps collect any snow.
